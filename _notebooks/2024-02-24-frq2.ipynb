    "<h3>Notes</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "I was REALLY stumped at first of how to approach this problem at first but W3Schools came in clutch to introduce to me the <b>\"indexOf method\"</b>. Based on its documentation and examples it seems to me that it is a built-in method that belongs to String class and is commonly used to find the index of the first occurence of a specific substring or character within a string. In the context of this FRQ, it is what allows me to find index where nugget (correct letter) isn't concealed. I don't really care where index is and just care if in there or not. It was most useful to learn that if nugget not in concealed string it will return -1 and I used this to cover the condition when the nugget is there but just not in correct position"

Since my group did the lesson about classes I remember pretty clearily to make classes and constructors public and instance variables private to restrict access to the declaring class.

    "- Of course can never forget to construct the main method where you can test if your logic method actually works with some sample hard-coded words. This is also where we can see the resemblance of a \"getter method\" when get hint from puzzle and checks if it is right"
