I found it helpful for myself to just jot down what a sparse array is in my own words (a big matrix w/mostly 0s and to not bother with all that memory you just track the nonzero) so I can better comprehend how to even start coding. \n",

This one seemed fairly simple to me because in the problem it is clear that there is only 3 pieces of information you can get from the entry which is row, column, and value. \n",
