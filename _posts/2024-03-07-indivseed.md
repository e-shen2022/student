<h2>AP Preparation Progress</h2>

<b>Number one takeaway from FRQs:</b> By going through this process of completing each FRQ and contemplating how the learning targets are reflected in my own group's project, my number one takeaway is that although the exact same type of data structure may not have been used, there are underlying principles and more abstract concepts that are easily comparable across many different files. 

Ex. Our project may not have explicitly used 2D arrays, but I can see that we stored information, iterated through them, and manipulated the elements to achieve a certain outcome using Lists and Maps or Tuples. I think that when I try to learn a subject I tend to gravitate towards just memorizing an exact step to step tutorial of how to solve a problem, but for computer science, I definitely believe that if you take the time to truly understand the big picture logical theories of how to handle data, figuring out what data structure or method will come with time.

<b>As the AP exam is approaching, I want to follow this schedule: </b>

3/7 - 3/24 Watch U1-10 College Board videos, take notes, do practice MC questions. Here is link to my working [MC Content Study Guide](https://e-shen2022.github.io/student/2024/03/07/apexamprep.html)

3/25 - 5/5 This will be my schedule:

Saturday: Complete past year FRQ exam 
Sunday: Correct & Reflect on what I learned and need to work on 
Monday-Friday: Work on school assigned work and draw parallels from the FRQs I jsut worked on 

Result: I can truly grasp the abstract concepts by implementing them into my PBL assignments which will not only prepare me for exam, but also allow me to improve my overall actual coding effiency for the future

<h2>Project Work</h2>

I am pretty excited for this trimester because I get to work with a team of people who are really motivated to do their own individual contributions to this project. I feel like this AP Exam / Course prep game will be genuinly useful for years to come. I think the main thing I can contribute is to facilitate discussion among each of the team members and organizing everyone's individual ideas into a cohesive concept. I also really want to experiment with cool game UI/UX design and also integrating cybergames as puzzle unlockers within their game map!
