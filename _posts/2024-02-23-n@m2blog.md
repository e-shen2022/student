<h1>2 Trimester focus planning</h1>

<h2>Capture test data</h2>

We polled people who tried out all of our existing features and found the average here: 

- Aesthetics: 9/10
- Fun: 5/10
- Educational: 10/10
- Come back again for long term sign up account: 7/10

<h2>Action items from feedback</h2>

From the ratings above, we believe the following changes should be made as we work to improve the user experience of our educational website: 

- Aesthetics: Format the frontend with better spacing (particularly my feature where it displayed a bunch of difference information of vulnerability details, fix instructions, severity level, and how to check if fix is completed)
- Fun: Implement the leaderboard to actually be connected to the user's account to add a competitive aspect + Instead of displaying user ID on leaderboard to show the name (keeps people accountable and connects students together)
- Educational: For the email phishing game it could be more intellectually stimulating to make it a "spot the difference" game where student has to specifically point out which part of email is a red flag. 
- Come back again: In order to improve the long-term use of our website, we want to add more levels to each game and allow the users to unlock some type of locked feature as they progress in their educational journey in cybersecurity 
- Other: For the password game, instead of having to manually press the check button every time to just make it so when user presses enter button it goes to next level

<h1>Individual Reflection</h1>

<h2> Glows !!!! </h2>

- I think when setting up the java backend I was really able to structure in a way that incorporated the practices we have been trying to master in CSA like separating code in diff files for organization (ex. api controller, database, template that extracts the key info from the api) and concepts like inheritance, constructors and methods, classes and objects

- I'm pretty happy with how I was able to add feature where if user hovers over a certain column a pop up is able to appear that elaborates on the context of what this column talks about. I think it was definitely helpful bc the api I pulled information from had some tech lingo that common people would not be able to understand

- I also thought adding a search option was good for my feature. User can easily locate details about vulnerabilities they are interested in (buffer overflow attacks, audit records, login)

- I deployed our GAVE-backend-v3!! I definitely feel like studying for the deployment quiz and going through each step has made me a lot more confident in being able to deploy on my own in the future

<h2> Grows !!!! </h2>

- An obvious grow for my feature is to somehow alter the information displayed so it is not in such a crypt cybersecurity tech lingo so that normal people can understand. I was thinking of filtering it through chat in trimester 3. 
- I also think the frontend formatting could be a lot more intuitive and nice to look at --> Instead of a table I was thinking of displaying each vulnerability info as a card. And then also add an option of "see more" so what is displayed is only how much the user wants to see
- However, on the other hand, I believe I need to work on using more tech lingo while demoing to people at N@M. Mr. Mort already brought this up during N@M check up but I definitely felt it when some software engineer parents were coming up to us and asking me more details on backend structure and I was stumbling on my words. Moving forward I want to be more confident and proficient in talking about code
- Something I think myself and rest of my group need to work on is using the remote branches in a productive way. I think we didn't really know how to organize everything and it ended up messing up some of our work

<h1>Blog on event</h1>

<h2>Something you saw in CompSci that impressed</h2>

Rachit's prepping for AP CS classes game! The UI was so nice (kudos to Luna) and the test questions seemed to have content that I believe would be genuinely useful for any student prepping for your classes in the future!!

<h2>Something you saw outside of CompSci that you liked</h2>

I ❤️ ❤️❤️❤️ going to see the pottery every N@M

These ocean animal themed cups were a favorite of mine and I like them even more because they are sharks on them. I feel like sharks have a negative perception because of how violent and hostile they are to humans but you can't really blame them it's just their animalistic nature. I think sharks are pretty cool and should be admired for the command they have over the sea!!
